# CDE_Assignement_2

To run this programme, You will need to have Python at the latest version so Python 3,

And will need to also install a few modules so that our programme can run, by running 
â€œpython -m pip install -r requirements.txt"

or 

"pip install -r requirements.txt"

To run our Programme you can simply run the file Run.py by 

"python3 Run.py" or  "python Run.py" 

This will run both the Server and Client GUI in the same terminal where you are able to see all the operations together

If you would like to individually open two separate terminals to see individual operations,

You will need to run the server first, to do this run this in the terminal
""python3 Server.py""

Then open a new terminal and Run the Client GUI
""python3 Client.py""
And now the programme is running, you are presented with an interface


We have also included our old Client(old).py file which includes our in-terminal application before we had a Kivy GUI, this had all of the required features and the code was just transfered to our Kivy GUI file to perform the functions, 

To try out our old client run the server first and then the client

'python3 Server.py' and then 'python3 Client(old).py'
